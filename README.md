This glob of utilities came out of a conversation I had at work that started as, 
"Wouldn't it be nice if there were utilities for our common pain points." 
After a quick searching in GitHub I found many that fit the bill and patched it 
all together. I did some minor scripting here, but others did the hard lift. 

Thank you community!



This utility is designed to run on linux utilizing bash scripts.
